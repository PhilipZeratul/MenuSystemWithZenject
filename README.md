# MenuSystemWithZenject

This project is a Unity Menu Framework inspired by \
**MenuSystem** \
https://github.com/YousicianGit/UnityMenuSystem \
Check their talk at Unity Europe 2017 at \

and **Zenject** \
https://github.com/modesttree/Zenject \

I started this project because my project is written with Zenject and I want the MenuSystem to work with Zenject as well.\
So inspired by the idea of MenuSystem, I did some modification to it and I think the result is quite pleasing.\
